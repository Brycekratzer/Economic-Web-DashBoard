# Economic Dashboard

A data-driven web application that visualizes the current state of the United States economy using FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and Yahoo Finance data. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to track market trends, economic indicators, and financial metrics.

## Features 

- **Automateed Data Pipiline** 

    Fetches and processes financial data from trusted sources on a regular schedule

- **Responsive Design** 

    Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Technology Used

- **Frontend**

    HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- **Data Visualization**

    D3.js

- **Data Processing**

    Python, pandas, pandas_ta

- **Data Sources**

    Yahoo Finance (yfinance), FRED (pandas_datareader)

- **Deployment and Automation**

    Github Pages, Github Actions

## Data Pipieline

1. **Data Collection**

    The system uses Python to fetch data from:

    - Yahoo Finance for stock market indices (S&P 500)
    - FRED API for economic indicators

2. **Data Processing**

    - update_data.py retrieves 50-day and 120-day historical data
    - Data is formatted and saved as CSV files in the `/data` directory

3. **Automated Updates**

    - GitHub Actions runs the data pipeline at 5:30 PM MST every weekday
    - Fresh data is committed back to the repository

## Visualization

1. **DS.js Rendering**

    - `display.js` loads the CSV data
    - Creates line charts with appropriate scales
    - Formats dates and values for clean presentation

2. **User Interface**

    - Clean, minimalist design implemented with custom CSS
    - Responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes

## Updates 

### March 30th 2025

Added Montary Policy Data, and moved the `updated_data.py` script to run only every Saturday as a good amount of economic indictors don't have readily available data updated daily.

### March 29th 2025

Updated diretory paths for smooth git action updates. Working on accessing `.csv` files from data directory in the app.js file. Made a simple pipeline structure for data preprocessing in `scripts/update_data.py`

Implemented the `display.js` file that was responsible for updating and adding graphs to the front end by using `D3`. Still need to modify the CSS file to edit how it looks and also include new files from FRED data via `pandas_ta`in the `update_data.py`

Also updated the `update-data.yml` file to only run at 5:30 PM MST every week day to help preserve github's free resources. 

### March 27th 2025

Added a new github action that add's dependency's for preprocessing data from yfinance and and FRED data.

This action adds a cache that has dependency's installed and if a new package is added everything is reinstalled. This helps with time management for deployment.

Also made it so we run the `update_data.py` file located in the `/scripts` directory every 6 hours. In theory, every 6 hours this script will run preprocessing a new set of data from yfinance and FRED then export into a csv file into the `/data` directory.

**Side Note**
Would be more beneficial to run the script at different hours of the day for example:

- First time running: 7:30am MST
    - When the stock market opens
    - New FRED economic data is added

- Second time running: 12pm MST
    - Mid day of trading

- Third time running: 5:30 MST
    - End of trading hours
    - Grabs any new FRED data that was updated later in the day

We could then make it update every weekday and not include weekends
