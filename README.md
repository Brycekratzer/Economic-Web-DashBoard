# Economic Dashboard

Economic dashboard is a project that will potentially allow for users to view a website that has a data driven insight on the
overall economic state of the United States using FRED and yfinance data

## Updates 

### March 29th 2025

Updated diretory paths for smooth git action updates. Working on accessing `.csv` files from data directory in the app.js file. Made a simple pipeline structure for data preprocessing in `scripts/update_data.py`

**Further Implementation**

The graph being displayed is a rough draft of what is to come. The main idea was to get the `d3` js library to integrate with the csv files. Still need to work on the visuals for the graph.



### March 27th 2025

Added a new github action that add's dependency's for preprocessing data from yfinance and and FRED data.
This action adds a cache that has dependency's installed and if a new package is added everything is reinstalled. This helps with time management for deployment.

Also made it so we run the `update_data.py` file located in the `/scripts` directory every 6 hours. In theory, every 6 hours this script will run preprocessing a new set of data from yfinance and FRED then export into a csv file into the `/data` directory.

**Side Note**
Would be more beneficial to run the script at different hours of the day for example:

- First time running: 7:30am MST
    - When the stock market opens
    - New FRED economic data is added

- Second time running: 12pm MST
    - Mid day of trading

- Third time running: 5:30 MST
    - End of trading hours
    - Grabs any new FRED data that was updated later in the day

We could then make it update every weekday and not include weekends
