                                    This graph displays the difference between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields, a key economic signal tracked by the Federal Reserve. 
                                    Positive values suggest future economic growth, while negative values (below zero) may indicate approaching economic downturns. 
                                    Financial experts use this "term spread" to calculate recession probability twelve months ahead, making it one of the most watched indicators for market timing decisions. 
                                    When the line crosses from negative to positive territory, it often signals significant economic transitions.

                                    This graph shows the difference between long-term interest rates (10-Year Treasury) and short-term interest rates (set by the Federal Reserve). 
                                    When the line is rising, it typically means the economy might grow in the future; when falling or below zero, it might signal economic troubles ahead. 
                                    This indicator helps investors understand if the Fed's current actions (raising or lowering short-term rates) are in line with what markets expect for the long-term economy. 
                                    Think of it as measuring the gap between what the Fed is doing now versus what investors believe will happen years from now.

                                    This graph shows how much it costs to borrow money in the United States. When the line goes up, borrowing becomes more expensive for everyone - affecting credit cards, mortgages, and business loans. 
                                    The Federal Reserve adjusts these rates to help control the economy - raising rates to slow inflation or lowering them to boost growth when the economy slows down. 
                                    Changes in interest rates directly impact your wallet - determining how much you pay for loans and how much you earn on savings. 
                                    When the line changes direction on the graph, it often signals major shifts in economic conditions that affect jobs, housing prices, and everyday costs.
